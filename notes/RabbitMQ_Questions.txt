*   What is RabbitMQ ?

>>  RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that facilitates communication between different applications, systems,
    or services.

    It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), but also supports other protocols like MQTT and STOMP.

    Essentially, RabbitMQ acts as a message queue, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling systems to improve
    scalability and reliability.

*   What are key concepts in RabbitMQ ?

>>  Below is the list of key concepts in RabbitMQ :

    (1) Producer: An application that sends messages to the queue.

    (2) Queue: A storage location where messages are held until they are consumed. Each message stays in the queue until processed.

    (3) Consumer: An application or service that receives and processes messages from the queue.

    (4) Exchange: Routes messages from producers to appropriate queues based on rules or routing keys.

    (5) Binding: A connection between an exchange and a queue, defining the routing logic.

    (6) Routing Key: A key that the producer assigns to the message, used by exchanges to determine the destination queue.

*   What are Connections and Channels in RabbitMQ ?

>>  In RabbitMQ, connections and channels are essential concepts that determine how producers and consumers interact with
    the broker. They play an important role in resource management, concurrency, and performance optimization.

    (1) Connections:

        A connection is a TCP connection between your application (producer or consumer) and the RabbitMQ server (broker).
        It serves as the communication bridge between the two.

        - Expensive to Create: Opening and maintaining a connection takes time and resources.

        - Long-Lived: Typically, connections are kept open for the duration of the application’s runtime, rather than opening and closing frequently.

        - Single Connection per Application: It's common to establish only one connection per application and reuse it across multiple components.

    (2) Channels:

        A channel is a lightweight, virtual connection that operates inside a real TCP connection.
        It allows multiple operations (e.g., publishing or consuming messages) to be carried out simultaneously over a single connection.

        - Lightweight: Channels are much cheaper to create and close than connections.

        - Concurrency: Each thread or process in your application can use its own channel, allowing parallel message processing.

        - Isolated State: Channels maintain their own state, such as consumer tags and queue bindings.

        - Multiple Channels per Connection: A single connection can handle many channels, making it efficient for applications with many concurrent tasks.

*   What are various types of message Acknowledgment mode from Consumer in RabbitMQ ?

>>  In RabbitMQ, message acknowledgment (ack) modes determine how messages are confirmed as successfully processed by consumers.

    Here are the main types of acknowledgment modes in RabbitMQ:

    (1) Automatic Acknowledgment (autoAck = true):

        Messages are automatically acknowledged by the RabbitMQ client library immediately after they are delivered to the consumer,
        regardless of whether they are successfully processed.

        There’s a risk of message loss if a consumer fails to process the message after receiving it since RabbitMQ assumes
        the message was successfully handled.

        ```
            @RabbitListener(queues = "<Queue_Name>", ackMode = "AUTO")
            public void listen(org.springframework.amqp.core.Message amqpMessage) {
                System.out.println("Received (AUTO): " + amqpMessage.getBody());
                // Message is automatically acknowledged after being received
            }
        ```

    (2) Manual Acknowledgment (autoAck = false):

        The consumer explicitly sends an acknowledgment back to RabbitMQ after processing the message.

        If the consumer does not acknowledge, RabbitMQ will keep the message in the queue or requeue it for another attempt (depending on settings).
        Manual acknowledgment provides more reliability, especially when a consumer might encounter processing errors or crashes.

        ```
            @RabbitListener(queues = "<Queue_Name>", ackMode = "MANUAL")
            public void listen(org.springframework.amqp.core.Message amqpMessage, Channel channel, @Header(AmqpHeaders.DELIVERY_TAG) long deliveryTag) {
                System.out.println("Received (MANUAL): " + amqpMessage.getBody());
                // Manually acknowledge the message
                channel.basicAck(deliveryTag, false);
            }
        ```

    (3) Negative Acknowledgment (nack):

        Consumers can reject messages using basicNack (negative acknowledgment).

        With basicNack, the consumer can specify whether the message should be requeued or discarded.
        This is useful for handling specific message-processing failures without affecting the rest of the message queue.

        ```
            @RabbitListener(queues = "<Queue_Name>", ackMode = "MANUAL")
            public void listen(org.springframework.amqp.core.Message amqpMessage, Channel channel, @Header(AmqpHeaders.DELIVERY_TAG) long deliveryTag) {
               System.out.println("Received (NACK, requeue): " + message);
               try {
                   // Simulate failure for demonstration
                   if (message.contains("fail")) {
                       throw new RuntimeException("Simulated processing failure");
                   }
                   // Manually acknowledge if successful
                   channel.basicAck(deliveryTag, false);
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   // Negative acknowledgment with requeue = true
                   channel.basicNack(deliveryTag, false, true);
               }
            }
        ```

    (4) Reject (reject):

        Similar to basicNack, the basicReject method allows a message to be explicitly rejected.

        It only allows the option to requeue or discard the message, without a multiple-message option.
        basicReject is a simpler form of nack, typically used for a single message acknowledgment.

        ```
            @RabbitListener(queues = "<Queue_Name>", ackMode = "MANUAL")
            public void listen(org.springframework.amqp.core.Message amqpMessage, Channel channel, @Header(AmqpHeaders.DELIVERY_TAG) long deliveryTag) {
               System.out.println("Received (REJECT, requeue): " + message);
               try {
                   // Simulate failure for demonstration
                   if (message.contains("fail")) {
                       throw new RuntimeException("Simulated processing failure");
                   }
                   // Manually acknowledge if successful
                   channel.basicAck(deliveryTag, false);
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   // Reject with requeue = true
                   channel.basicReject(deliveryTag, true);
               }
            }
        ```
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the difference between Reject with requeue=true and Negative Acknowledgment requeue=true ?

>>  In RabbitMQ, both basicReject and basicNack are used to negatively acknowledge messages, meaning they inform RabbitMQ
    that the message was not processed successfully.

    However, there are subtle differences in how they work:

    (1) Reject with requeue=true:

        - basicReject can only handle a single message at a time and does not support batch acknowledgment
        - When you use basicReject with requeue=true, the rejected message will be placed back in the queue for another consumer to attempt processing.

    (2) Negative Acknowledgment with requeue=true:

        - basicNack is more flexible, as it can handle multiple messages at once, depending on the configuration (it has a multiple parameter).
        - The basicNack method is often preferred for scenarios where you want to reject multiple messages simultaneously.
        - When used with requeue=true, it behaves similarly to basicReject, putting the message(s) back into the queue for redelivery.

*   What are lazy queues ?

>>  Lazy Queues in RabbitMQ are such a queue which optimize memory usage by storing messages on disk instead of in memory.

    This feature is particularly useful for handling high volumes of messages, preventing memory exhaustion and maintaining
    performance.

    Lazy queues are ideal for scenarios with sporadic message processing or bursts of messages, ensuring that larger
    volumes can be managed efficiently.

    While lazy queues help with memory usage, they may have slightly higher latency for message processing since messages
    are read from disk rather than memory.

    Stream and quorum queues do not support lazy loading.

    ```
        @Bean
        public Queue lazyQueue() {
            Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<>();
            args.put("x-queue-type", "classic");
            args.put("x-lazy", true); // Specify that this is a lazy queue
            return new Queue("lazy.queue", true, false, false, args);
        }
    ```

*   How to work with Priority Queues in Rabbit MQ ?

>>  To work with priority queues in RabbitMQ (RMQ), you need to follow these steps:

    (1) When you declare a queue, you can specify that it supports priority by setting the 'x-max-priority' argument.

        ```
            @Bean
            public Queue PriorityMessageQueue() {
                Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<>();
                args.put("x-queue-type", QueueType.CLASSIC);
                args.put("x-max-priority", 255);
                return new Queue("q.priority.message", true, false, false, args);
            }
        ```

    (2) When you publish messages to the queue, you can set the priority for each message. Higher priority values will
        be processed first.

        ```
            public void publishPriorityQueueMessages(String queueName, List<Video> videos) {
            MessagePostProcessor messagePostProcessor = message -> {
                    try {
                        Video video = objectMapper.readValue(message.getBody(), Video.class);
                        message.getMessageProperties().setPriority(video.getPriority());
                    }
                    catch (Exception ex) {
                        message.getMessageProperties().setPriority(1);
                    }
                    message.getMessageProperties().setHeader("user", "Abhishek");
                    message.getMessageProperties().setDeliveryMode(MessageDeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT);
                    message.getMessageProperties().setContentEncoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString());
                    message.getMessageProperties().setContentType(MessageProperties.CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_PLAIN);
                    return message;
                };
                videos.forEach(video -> {
                    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(queueName, video, messagePostProcessor);
                });
            }
        ```
