*   What is Federation and shovel in RabbitMQ ?

>>  RabbitMQ Federation and Shovel are tools that help connect different RabbitMQ servers to move messages between them.

    Here’s a simple breakdown of each:

    (1) RabbitMQ Federation:

        Think of it as a subscription system:

            Federation allows one RabbitMQ server (or cluster) to subscribe to messages from another RabbitMQ server,
            like following updates on a blog or social media.

        Use case:

            It’s great when you want to share data between servers that aren’t always connected or are far apart
            (e.g., servers in different cities or countries).

        How it works:

            The server receiving messages (downstream) pulls them from the server that’s sharing them (upstream) when needed.
            If the connection breaks, it will reconnect later and continue receiving messages.

    (2) RabbitMQ Shovel:

        Think of it as a moving service:

            Shovel picks up messages from one RabbitMQ server or queue and puts them into another,
            like a delivery truck moving packages between warehouses.

        Use case:

            It’s useful when you need to continuously and reliably transfer messages from one place to another,
            even across different networks.

        How it works:

            Shovel actively takes messages from a source and pushes them to a destination. If the connection fails,
            it tries again until the job is done, making it reliable for moving messages.

*   How Federation is different from Shovel ?

>>  Here are the key differences:

    (1) Purpose and Use Case

        Federation:

            - Primarily used for connecting brokers in a loosely-coupled manner, often over unreliable or long-distance network connections.
            - It is suitable for sharing messages between multiple RabbitMQ clusters that may not always be connected.

        Shovel:

            - Used for reliably transferring messages from one broker (or queue) to another, even across different networks.
            - Shovel acts as a persistent connection, ensuring that messages are transferred regardless of network reliability.

    (2) Mechanism

        Federation:

            - Works at the exchange or queue level, allowing a RabbitMQ cluster to subscribe to another's exchange or queue.
            - Messages are pulled on demand. If the downstream cluster is disconnected, messages will accumulate on the upstream exchange/queue until reconnection.

        Shovel:

            - Acts as a consumer on the source broker and a producer on the destination broker, continuously pulling messages and pushing them to the target.
            - Has a more straightforward setup that creates a tunnel between a source and a destination, handling reconnections and ensuring message delivery.

    (3) Message Delivery and Reliability

        Federation:

            - More resilient for sporadic or intermittent connections.
            - If the link between clusters fails, it waits until reconnection and then resumes message delivery.

        Shovel:

            - Ensures guaranteed delivery through persistent storage if configured with acknowledgement settings.
            - This makes it ideal for reliable, continuous transfers where messages must not be lost.

    (4) Performance Considerations

        Federation:

            - May have higher latency since messages are pulled only when required.
            - Better suited for scenarios where data flow can be bursty or is not critical in real-time.

        Shovel:

            - Tends to have lower latency as it continuously transfers messages, maintaining a steady flow of data between brokers.
            - Ideal for scenarios where continuous, reliable message transfer is required.
