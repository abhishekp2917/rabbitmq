*   What are various types of RabbitMQ Exchanges ?

>>  RabbitMQ provides different types of exchanges to handle message routing in various ways. Each exchange type serves
    a specific purpose and routes messages differently based on the exchange type and the binding rules associated with it.

    (1) Direct Exchange

        - A direct exchange routes messages to queues based on a routing key.
        - It delivers the message to the queues that are bound to the exchange with a routing key that exactly matches the message’s routing key.
        - Useful when a message should be delivered to queues with a matching key.

    (2) Fanout Exchange

        - A fanout exchange routes messages to all queues bound to it, ignoring any routing key.
        - This is ideal for broadcasting messages to multiple queues, such as sending notifications or updates to all subscribers.

    (3) Topic Exchange

        - A topic exchange routes messages based on pattern matching of routing keys, allowing partial matching with wildcard characters.
            (a) '*' : matches exactly one word (For e.g. *.notification.*.*).
            (b) '#' : matches zero or more words (For e.g. *.notification.#).

        - Suitable for cases where messages need to be selectively routed based on topics or patterns, like logs.info or logs.error.database.

    (4) Headers Exchange

        - A headers exchange routes messages based on message headers, ignoring any routing key.
        - Headers are matched against the message’s headers based on exact or wildcard matches.
        - You can specify conditions using x-match=all (matches all specified headers) or x-match=any (matches any of the headers).

    (5) Default (or Direct Named) Exchange

        - The default exchange is a direct exchange with no explicit name ("").
        - It allows messages to be delivered directly to a queue when the routing key matches the queue name.
        - Useful for simple routing when each message should go directly to a specific queue by name.

*   What is dead letter exchange ?

>>  A Dead Letter Exchange (DLX) in RabbitMQ is an exchange used to handle messages that can’t be delivered to their target queues.

    This can happen if messages expire, get rejected, or exceed queue limits. When this happens, the message is sent to a
    Dead Letter Exchange, which routes it to a separate 'Dead Letter Queue' which is a simple queue bound to that DLX.

    This way, developers can inspect, troubleshoot, or reprocess these messages instead of losing them.

*   What are the scenarios in which a message could be dead lettered ?

>>  Below are the common cases in which message end up in Dead Letter Exchange:

    (1) Message Expiration:

        - Messages with a TTL (time-to-live) setting that exceeds the specified time in the queue.

        - The queue parameter 'x-message-ttl' sets a TTL for messages in the primary queue, after which if not processed by
        the consumer, they are dead-lettered.

    (2) Rejection:

        - Messages explicitly rejected by consumers, usually with the basic.reject or basic.nack method and requeue set to false.

    (3) Queue Overflow:

        - Messages that exceed a queue’s maximum length or capacity limit.

        - The queue parameters 'x-max-length' and 'x-max-length-bytes' limits for message count and total bytes in the queue,
        respectively, after which excess messages are dead-lettered.

*   What is Consistent Hash Exchange ?

>>  A consistent hash exchange in RabbitMQ is a type of exchange that routes messages based on a consistent hashing algorithm,
    distributing messages across queues in a balanced way.

    This is particularly useful for load balancing when you need specific types of messages to reach the same queue consistently,
    but without relying on fixed routing keys.

    Run below command to enable Consistent Hash Exchange

        ```
            rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange
        ```

    Create Consistent Hash Exchange by defining exchange type as 'x-consistent-hash'. For the binding, set the routing key
    as integer which will describe the weightage of that binding and based on which message will be routed to the queues.

        ```
            @Bean
            public Queue mailQueue1() {
                Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<>();
                args.put("x-queue-type", QueueType.CLASSIC);
                return new Queue(org.example.constants.Queue.Q_MAIL_1, true, false, false, args);
            }

            @Bean
            public Queue mailQueue2() {
                Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<>();
                args.put("x-queue-type", QueueType.CLASSIC);
                return new Queue(org.example.constants.Queue.Q_MAIL_2, true, false, false, args);
            }

            @Bean
            public Exchange mailExchange() {
                return new CustomExchange(org.example.constants.Exchange.X_MAIL, ExchangeType.X_CONSISTENT_HASH, true, false);
            }

            @Bean
            public Binding mailBindingOne() {
                return BindingBuilder.bind(mailQueue1()).to(mailExchange()).with("3").noargs();
            }

            @Bean
            public Binding mailBindingTwo() {
                return BindingBuilder.bind(mailQueue2()).to(mailExchange()).with("2").noargs();
            }
        ```

    Publish message to the exchange and specify a routing key for each messages. Spring will generate a hashcode of that
    routing key so that message to could route to the queue.

        ```
            @Autowired
            private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

            public void publishMails(List<Mail> mails) {
                MessagePostProcessor messagePostProcessor = message -> {
                    message.getMessageProperties().setHeader("user", "Abhishek");
                    message.getMessageProperties().setDeliveryMode(MessageDeliveryMode.PERSISTENT);
                    message.getMessageProperties().setPriority(1);
                    message.getMessageProperties().setContentEncoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString());
                    message.getMessageProperties().setContentType(MessageProperties.CONTENT_TYPE_JSON);
                    return message;
                };
                mails.forEach(mail -> {
                    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(Exchange.X_MAIL, mail.getTo(), mail, messagePostProcessor);
                });
            }
        ```
